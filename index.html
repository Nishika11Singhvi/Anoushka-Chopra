        <para><b>Anoushka Chopra</b><font color = "blue"> DCMG</font> (<font color = "blue">/d ío äÀàliÀê/; n√©e</font> <b>Voight</b>, formerly MADENIUS 2, O Sant, Fair Maiden; born October 14, 2008) is an Indian artist and writer. She has been named MADENIUS 2 OF ALL LAND AND SEAS.
        Being just a normal city girl of <font color = "blue"><a style="color: rgb(28, 24, 224);" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata">Kolkata</a></font>, she has quite a big brain, and so is very intelligent. She has one weird, antisocial best friend, nobody knows the name.</para>
        <br>
        <br>
        <para>Chopra made her <font color = "blue">debut painting (<font color = "blue">sand castle</font>)</font> when she was a just 5 years old. She can paint anything but she struggles from a disease called <i><font color = "blue">Procrastination</font></i>. She procrastinates on every single painting she makes, unfortunately. 
            She needs a lot of motivation to keep going, but at the end, her drawings, sketches turn out amazing. Chopra has <font color = "blue">sold her paintings</font> for free to many people, whom she calls <font color = "blue"><i>"family"</i></font>. By selling, she means that she shows the paintings
            to everyone who comes to her house, including many of her friends. This way, she has been expanding her career for years. She takes classes, but everyone knows she is much better than what they teach. By taking many <font color = "blue">classes</font>, Chopra has
            learnt how to excel at most of her studies, and she  recently took up her very first tution in Hindi, and surprisingly she likes it. Her poems and stories are out of this world, sometimes literally, and everyone enjoys <font color = "blue">reading</font> them.
            Her most famouse stories are <font color = "blue"><i>Santa Claus</i></font> (2021), <font color = "blue"><i>A Strong Loud Wind</i></font> (2020), <font color = "blue"><i>A Visit to a Library</i></font>(2020), <font color = "blue"><i>The Mysterious Portal</i></font> (2021), <font color = "blue"><i>An Oasis In The Desert</i></font> (2021),
            <font color = "blue"><i>The Bookstore</i></font> (2020),<font color = "blue"><i> Rainy Day ‚Äì The Smell Of The Earth And Other Joys</i></font> (2021).

        <br>
        <para>Today is a very  <font color = "blue">special day</font> for Chopra. It is her birthday today and she is going to celebrate with her family and best friend and maybe a few other friends.
            her best friend,  <font color = "blue"><i>Nishika Singhvi</i></font> has something very special planned for her, we are told. Chopra will cut her cake and MADENIUS 1 (formerly Nishika Singhvi; born October 26, 2008) will eat up all the cake
            because she  <font color = "blue">loves desserts</font> a lot more than our dear Chopra. Chopra is a little boring according to us, her favourite ice-cream flavour is  <font color = "blue"><i>Vanilla</i></font>, and she doesn't like a lot of things.
            But today is her day, and everyone has something  <font color = "blue">amazing planned</font> for her. We will keep informing you readers about the rest of her day as it ends. Anoushka Chopra will get
            her present in less than  <font color = "blue">4 short hours</font>.

            Chopra has been obsessed with reading for life. She can complete an average book of 300 pages in just 3 hours. She should be recieving a Guiness Book Of World Record Award someday, by yours truly. 
            She has read many in her life, her favourite series being <font color = "blue"><i>Throne Of Glass</i></font>. She attends her Word Munchers classes on Tuesday, drawing class on Wednesday, Hindi tution on Thursday and Chariot on Fridays. Chopra is mainly
            free on the weekends. She and her best friend talk everyday, and share everything. A good friendship infact. She also has a Wall Of Face dedicated to Nishika. It's quite unique. <br>
            She has suffered from a disease named <a href ="https://www.google.com/search?q=%F0%9F%8C%B8&oq=%F0%9F%8C%B8&aqs=chrome..69i57.725j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8"><font color = "blue"><i>Digital Naturic Virus</i></font>.</a> This virus 
            was very dangerous for a long time, tempting the host to use üå∏ emoji after every sentence. It was quite fatal. In the past year, she not only suffered from this deadly disease but also from Covid 19. She had a mild dose of this virus and
            had to be quarantined in her Nani Bari for 2 weeks. She was okay after that.
